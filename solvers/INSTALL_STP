STP is published under an MIT license.

To get the sources, execute the following commands:

  $ git clone https://github.com/stp/stp.git
  $ cd stp

One easy way to install STP is as follows:

  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ cmake -G 'Unix Makefiles' ..
  $ make

If the static Boost libraries are not installed
on your machine, check out the following link:

  https://github.com/stp/stp/issues/96

Another known issue is that STP does not currently
support multiple solver instances. This manifests
itself as TermToConstTermUsingModel fatal errors:

  https://github.com/stp/stp/issues/97

More detailed installation instructions can be found
in the stp/INSTALL file. For example, on OS X (10.9)
with MacPorts already setup, another way to install
as well as automatically test STP is as follows:

  $ sudo easy_install lit
  $ git submodule init
  $ git submodule update
  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ cmake -G 'Unix Makefiles' -DENABLE_TESTING=ON ..
  $ make
  $ make check
