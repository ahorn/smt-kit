On OS X (10.8) with Mac Ports, a recent JDK and standard development
tools already installed, we successfully built CVC4 with these commands:

  git clone https://github.com/CVC4/CVC4.git
  cd CVC4
  git checkout tags/1.2
  ./autogen.sh
  mkdir target
  sudo port selfupdate
  sudo port upgrade outdated
  contrib/mac-build
  ./configure --prefix=`pwd`/target \
              --with-antlr-dir=`pwd`/antlr-3.4 \
              ANTLR=`pwd`/antlr-3.4/bin/antlr3 \
              CPPFLAGS=-I/opt/local/include \
              LDFLAGS=-L/opt/local/lib
  make
  make check
  make install

Note that the configuration above will use the default compiler. On our system,
we found that setting a non-default compiler (e.g. CXX=g++-mp-4.8 and CXX=clang++)
results in regression errors.

If you encounter other problems during the build, there are several helpful
Wiki pages, e.g. http://cvc4.cs.nyu.edu/wiki/Build_Problems.
