CVC4 is published under a permissive open-source BSD-style license.
Build instructions can be found online:

  http://cvc4.cs.nyu.edu/wiki/Building_CVC4_from_source

Note that smt-kit must be compiled with the same compiler as used for CVC4.

On OS X (10.9) with Mac Ports, a recent JDK and standard development
tools already installed, we successfully built CVC4 with these commands:

  git clone https://github.com/CVC4/CVC4.git
  cd CVC4
  git checkout tags/1.3
  ./autogen.sh
  mkdir target
  sudo port selfupdate
  sudo port upgrade outdated
  contrib/mac-build
  ./configure --prefix=`pwd`/target \
              --with-antlr-dir=`pwd`/antlr-3.4 \
              ANTLR=`pwd`/antlr-3.4/bin/antlr3 \
              CPPFLAGS=-I/opt/local/include \
              LDFLAGS=-L/opt/local/lib \
              CXX=clang++ \
              CXXFLAGS='-stdlib=libstdc++' \
              CPPFLAGS='-stdlib=libstdc++'
  make
  make check
  make install

If you encounter other problems during the build, there are several helpful
Wiki pages, e.g. http://cvc4.cs.nyu.edu/wiki/Build_Problems.
