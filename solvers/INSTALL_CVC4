CVC4 is published under a permissive open-source BSD-style license.
Build instructions can be found online:

  http://cvc4.cs.nyu.edu/wiki/Building_CVC4_from_source

Note 1: On our system, we could not link smt-kit and CVC4-1.4 when
        smt-kit was compiled with clang++.

Note 2: Starting in CVC4-1.4, we have noticed errors on freeing memory.

First download the CVC4 source code and create a build directory as follows:

  git clone https://github.com/CVC4/CVC4.git
  cd CVC4
  ./autogen.sh
  mkdir target

On OS X (10.9) with Mac Ports, a recent JDK and standard development
tools already installed, we successfully built CVC4 with these commands:

  sudo port selfupdate
  sudo port upgrade outdated
  contrib/mac-build
  ./configure --prefix=`pwd`/target \
              --with-antlr-dir=`pwd`/antlr-3.4 \
              ANTLR=`pwd`/antlr-3.4/bin/antlr3 \
              LDFLAGS=-L/opt/local/lib \
              CXX=g++ \
              CXXFLAGS='-I/opt/local/include' \
              CPPFLAGS='-I/opt/local/include'
  make
  make check
  make install

On GNU/Linux, the following build instructions should work with g++:

  contrib/get-antlr-3.4
  ./configure --prefix=`pwd`/target \
              --with-antlr-dir=`pwd`/antlr-3.4 \
              ANTLR=`pwd`/antlr-3.4/bin/antlr3

If you encounter other problems during the build, there are several helpful
Wiki pages, e.g. http://cvc4.cs.nyu.edu/wiki/Build_Problems.

The CVC4 mailing list is also very helpful.
