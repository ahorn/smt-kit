MathSAT5 is developed by FBK-IRST and the University of Trento:

  http://mathsat.fbk.eu/

Binaries can be downloaded from above for noncommercial use only.
Extract the files to the directory "solvers/msat" because Autoconf
looks there to link the SMT Kit source code.

If you wish to compile SMT Kit with clang++, then download the MathSAT5
binaries that are compiled against LLVM's C++11 standard library (libc++).

This compiler portability issue has been reported to mathsat@fbk.eu.
