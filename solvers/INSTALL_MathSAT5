MathSAT5 is developed by FBK-IRST and the University of Trento:

  http://mathsat.fbk.eu/

Binaries can be downloaded from above for noncommercial use only.
Extract the files to the directory "solvers/msat" because Autoconf
looks there to link the SMT Kit source code.

Note that currently the MathSAT5 binaries cannot be linked with LLVM's
C++11 standard library (libc++). This prevents compiling SMT Kit with
clang++ on OS X. As a workaround, g++ from Mac Ports works fine.

This compiler portability issue has been reported to mathsat@fbk.eu.
