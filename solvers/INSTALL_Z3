See the z3/README file for instructions on how to compile the Z3 source code
with any of the following compilers: Visual Studio, g++ or clang++.

You should always use the latest version of Z3:

  cd z3
  git checkout unstable
  mkdir target

On Linux with g++, Z3's unstable branch can be built as follows:

  python scripts/mk_make.py --prefix=`pwd`/target
  cd build
  make
  make install

On OS X (10.9) with clang++, the following build instructions
should work for Z3's unstable branch:

  CXX=clang++ CC=clang python scripts/mk_make.py
  cd build
  make
