# SMT Kit

SMT Kit is (an optionally type-safe) C++11 domain-specific language
to create [SMT-LIB][smt-lib] 2.0 formulas for Z3 and MathSAT5.

[smt-lib]: http://www.smt-lib.org/

## Prerequisite

For SMT Kit to work, SMT solvers must be installed separately.
Read their software licences carefully.

Currently, SMT Kit supports [Z3][z3] and [MathSAT5][msat]. Installation
instructions can be found in the `solvers/` directory.

[z3]: http://z3.codeplex.com/
[msat]: http://mathsat.fbk.eu/

## Installation

To build SMT Kit on a (mostly) POSIX-compliant operating system,
execute the following commands from the `smt-kit` folder:

    $ ./autogen.sh
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make test
    $ make install

If `./configure` fails, you may have to set environment variables
such as `CXX` and `CXXFLAGS`. For example, to compile on OS X with
LLVM use the command `./configure CXX=clang++ CXXFLAGS=-stdlib=libc++`.
But see also the troubleshooting section below.

If `make test` fails, you can still install, but it is likely that some
features of this library will not work correctly on your system.
Proceed at your own risk.

Note that `make install` may require superuser privileges.

For advanced usage information on other configure options refer to the
[Autoconf documentation][autoconf].

## API Usage

First, `#include <smt>`. An example with built-in operators follows:

```C++
smt::Term<smt::Bool> x = smt::any<smt::Bool>("x");
smt::Term<smt::Bool> y = smt::any<smt::Bool>("y");
smt::Term<smt::Bool> lhs = !(x && y);
smt::Term<smt::Bool> rhs = !x || !y;

smt::Z3Solver z3_solver;
z3_solver.add(lhs != rhs);
assert(smt::unsat != z3_solver.check());

// Should always explicitly specify the logic!
smt::MsatSolver msat_solver(smt::QF_BV_LOGIC);
msat_solver.add(lhs != rhs);
assert(smt::unsat == msat_solver.check());
```

Several more examples including incremental solving, function applications
and array logic expressions can be found in the [functional tests][api].

If Doxygen is installed on your system, SMT Kit's documentation can also
be automatically generated by the command `make doc`.

## Troubleshooting

Since SMT Kit uses advanced C++11 language features, older compiler
versions are likely to be troublesome. To date, we have successfully
compiled and tested the code on OS X with g++ 4.8.1 and clang++ 4.2.
But the choice of compiler also depends on the underlying SMT solvers.
In particular, MathSAT5 on OS X does not currently link with clang++
and LLVM's C++11 standard library (libc++). As a workaround, g++ from
Mac Ports works fine. This compiler portability issue has been reported
to mathsat@fbk.eu.
